How can you secure your s3:

To secure your Amazon S3 buckets:
 1.	blocl all public acess at both bucket level and account level
 2 then i would create a bucket policy to allow access only from specific IAM users and roles.
 3 we will give least privillage access through iam  roles based on the users role.
 2.	Encryption: Encrypt data at rest (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) and in transit (using HTTPS).
 5.	Lifecycle Policies: Automatically manage and delete old or unnecessary data.
 7.	VPC Endpoints: Use private connections for S3 access within a VPC.
