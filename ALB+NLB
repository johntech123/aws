ALB                                                                           NLB
✅ Works at Layer 7 (Application Layer)                                      Works at Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
   support http and https protocal                                            supprt TCP & UDP protocol
✅ Advance feature like path-based routing, host, or headers                 Routes based on IP address and port                
✅ Good for HTTP/HTTPS traffic                                               Good for TCP UDP traffic or high-speed, low-latency requirements like gaming
  Good for web application or microservices architecture                      
  support ssl termination
  Slightly higher (more processing) bcz it reads header 


When would you use an ALB over an NLB?
Use an ALB for applications that need content-based routing, like web applications or microservices and api that require advance routing and security feature.
Use an NLB for high-performance low latency applications such as gaming, real time streaming and u know that require fast handling of TCP/UDP traffic.

 layer 7 vs layer 4:

layer-7:
see layer 7 (application layer besically looks at the actual content of the request (like Urls, headers) it understand the http and https protocols,it can route traffic
based on path like if request comes for /login it goes to the login service its u know a smart receptionist who understand the request.

layer4(transport layer):
this layer only looks at ip adresses and port number it doesnt care whats inside the request, it handles TCP & UDP protocol.
